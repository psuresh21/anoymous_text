# anoymous_text
anonymous is the very secret way to show your random numbers to text. it's hard to recognize a people's why numbers are there in the text file. it is impossible to read too

# you follow these rules:
 - a for 1, b for 2, c for 3, d for 4 (instead of characters use numbers, a to z, 1 to 26)
 - .. means space
 
Example:

```
mysecret.txt
2.1.4..2.1.4.
```
```
output from mysecret.txt
bad bad

```
# Pros:

- a new way of talking with people's

# prerequisite:
   - Python 3.6+
   - should have basic knowledge in python
